# signup-page
A little The Matrix sign up page made with Node.js ❤

It uses the Mailchimp API to manage a newsletter subscribers list, but it's current API Key was automatically disabled for being within this repository, which is a public one.

However, the API works perfectly as it was tested, locally, and the `success.html` page and the `failure.html` page work accordingly to their purpose.
A `404` gives you the `failure.html`; a `200` gives you the `success.html` 🙂

A new API Key will be generated and the newsletter will be working perfectly, I just need a couple days to get back to it.
