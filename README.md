# signup-page
A simple The Matrix sign up page made with Node.js ❤

It uses the Mailchimp API to manage a newsletter subscribers list.

The API works perfectly as it was tested, locally. The `success.html` page and the `failure.html` page work accordingly to their purpose.
A 404 gives you the `failure.html`; a 200 gives you the `success.html` 🙂

<strike>A new API Key will be generated and the newsletter will be working perfectly, I just need a couple days to get back to it.</strike>
Old API key re-enabled and functional!
